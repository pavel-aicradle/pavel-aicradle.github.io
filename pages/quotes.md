	# Favorite Quotations
		
	"Big breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary."
	-Thomas Friedman

	"How much richer would the whole world be if the reinforcers in daily life were more effectively contingent on productive work?"
	-B. F. Skinner

	"College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes without passing through the brains of either."
	-Mark Twain

	"The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."
	-Plutarch

	"'I'm not good with stats' -Vince
	yet likes to tell Tyrone we are doing statistical analysis."
	-Ivan

	"Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria."
	-Sir John Templeton

	"The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right."
	-Learned Hand

	"The intellectual wants the whole society to be a school writ large, to be like the environment where he did so well and was so well appreciated. By incorporating standards of reward that are different from the wider society, the schools guarantee that some will experience downward mobility later. Those at the top of the school’s hierarchy will feel entitled to a top position, not only in that micro-society but in the wider one, a society whose system they will resent when it fails to treat them according to their self-prescribed wants and entitlements."
	-Robert Nozick

	" To the intellectually meritorious went the praise, the teacher’s smiles, and the highest grades. In the currency the schools had to offer, the smartest constituted the upper class. Though not part of the official curricula, in the schools the intellectuals learned the lessons of their own greater value in comparison with the others, and of how this greater value entitled them to greater rewards."
	-Nozick

	"You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
	Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

	"Official favor, grades, and other trinkets of subordination have no connection with education; they are the paraphernalia of servitude, not of freedom."
	-Gatto

	"Aristotle saw, a long time ago, that fully participating in a complex range of human affairs was the only way to become fully human."
	-Gatto

	"At some level Peterson is offering assertiveness training to men whom society is trying to turn into emasculated snowflakes."
	-David Brooks, nytimes

	"Rather, I want to suggest what may be a wider lesson about software, (and probably about every kind of creative or professional work). Human beings generally take pleasure in a task when it falls in a sort of optimal-challenge zone; not so easy as to be boring, not too hard to achieve. A happy programmer is one who is neither underutilized nor weighed down with ill-formulated goals and stressful process friction. *Enjoyment predicts efficiency.*"
	-Steven Raymond, Cathedral vs Bazaar

	"It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source's success will be to teach us that play is the most economically efficient mode of creative work."
	-Steven Raymond, Cathedral vs Bazaar

	"I you do not love yourself entirely and actively ensure your own needs are met, you will find it difficult to do the same for others."
	-Zaid Dahhaj

	"A goal without a plan is just a wish."
	-Harold Tharp

	"When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep."
	-Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand of Darkness

	"There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript. Many of these things are true. When I was required to write something in JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to despise it. It would accept almost anything I typed but interpret it in a way that was completely different from what I meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you."
	-Marijn Haverbeke, Eloquent Javascript

	"Solzhenitsyn said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech 'A single person who stops lying can bring down a tyranny.', which is a stunning thing to say, but I would also say something that's been amply demonstrated in the 20th century, because we have historical examples of people who did precisely that. Gandhi did it. Vaclav Havel did it. Nelson Mandela did it. Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago was definitely one of the axe-blows that brought down the Soviet Union, a stunning achievement for a person who started writing that book by memorizing it when he was a concentration camp victim this [holds up pinched fingers] far away from starvation. It shows you as-as clearly as anything possibly can how powerful the human spirit can be if it's willing to take on the obligation of its relationship with the divine and also how terrible things can become if the responsibility of that burden is not shouldered."
	-Jordan Peterson

	"Hello learned and astonishingly attractive pupils. My name is John Green, and I want to welcome you to Crash Course: World History. Over the next 40 weeks together we will learn how in a mere 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering—
	Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Mr.—Is this gonna be on the test?
	Yeah, about the test: The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world, and it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dormrooms and in places of worship. You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football, and while scrolling through your Twitter feed. The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages, whether you’ll be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric, and whether you’ll be able to place your life and your community in a broader context. The test will last your entire life, and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that when taken together make your life yours. And everything, *everything* will be on it.
	I know, right? So pay attention."
	-John Green
