The theme expects to find a `purple_stars.jpg` and `purple_stars_light.jpg` here, which will be used as the welcome section background.

It's also going to try to link the resume pdf named exactly as this one is.

I've separated these heavier assets to keep the remote theme light, so I can actually download it for testing in a reasonable amount of time on my slow tethered internet.
