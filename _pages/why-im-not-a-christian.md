Why I'm Not a Christian

Why it's fruitless to just debate with people. How long I've wanted to write this. Why. How I heard growing up about how kids and everyone seemed to be drifting away from God, about the agenda of "liberal" professors. How I hardened my heart and thought that wouldn't be me, but how that's not how it was at all, how thoroughly the church misunderstood and continues to misunderstand. How I really do want them to understand, to remember how they trusted me, to take a more nuanced view of the world.

Whispers for why no god:
- Messy organs/imperfect evolution (inefficiency of photosynthesis, for example)
- Radiocarbon dating, fossils, mitochondria, similarity of bone structures -> God would have to be misleading us
- No convincing solution to the Problem of Evil (battle to give us free will and the chance to choose a side doesn't make sense in light of senseless tragedy, like dead children who never got to have out that inner struggle. Moreover, why would God run this experiment if he's all-knowing and capable of saying who will make it and who will be thrown in the lake of fire?)
- History of religion (idea viruses, born, evolve, die + presence of shitty things in the Bible like slavery and genital mutilation)
- Why should God judge us by morality when morality didn't always exist? Why should belief in God be the prerequisite to enter heaven? Did Gandhi go to hell?
- Psychology: Confirmation bias, "We are never decieved; we decieve ourselves.", our love to believe things that seem pleasant.
- The church as a power system trying to maintain power. The corrupt nature. Abuse by priests and so on.
- God's shrinking place (spirits in the stars and trees and the harvest that we don't see anymore)

[That philosophy stackexchange thread is probably a great place to look too, but don't let this vear too far off personal]

Taken together they paint a picture. I can't say definitively no God based on the evidence, but can you say there definitively is? Can you be completely sure you aren't fooling yourself? On whom does the burden of proof lie? What is the more fantastic claim, God or no God?

But science isn't perfect (regress article). End of progress. The difficulty we now face.

But fundamentally it comes down to "Lean not on your own understanding". Do you have faith in our abilities to seek and find the truth, or do you believe in revelation? What is more trustworthy? The aggregate of human seeking based on our best faculties, or the words in a millennia-old book with a dubious history? (No census at Jesus' birth, for instance. The Romans kept records. No census. Timeline with King Herod not sensible either. The gospels written actually many decades after Jesus' death. Isn't a legend more likely?)

I can't convince anyone outright; he must convince himself. But the reasonable conclusion appears to be that God is not there, that if he exists, he is either not benevolent, not all powerful, or not paying attention.

Listen to Letting Go of God. Probably the best, most comprehensive, most compassionate, most complete picture of what it was like.

Something about why else the church is losing the culture war: Illiberalism w.r.t. sex, drugs, generally enjoying life, immigration (conservative, selfish evangelicals), abortion, denying climate science, denying evolution.
