Here lies everything that makes the theme work, the appearance stuff.

- pictures for backgrounds and icons
- css that I don't want fetched over CDN (`bootstrap.min.css`) and `agency.css` that I wrote to extend Bootstrap and customize my theme's appearance
- javascript related to elements of my theme, to give them custom behavior
